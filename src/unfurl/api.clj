(defn unfurl
  "Unfurls the given url, throwing an exception if the url is invalid, returning
  nil if the given url is nil or not supported, or a map containing some or all
  of the following keys (none of which are mandatory):

    {
      :url           - The url of the resource, according to the server
      :title         - The title of the given url
      :description   - The description of the given url
      :preview-url   - The url of a preview image for the given url

  Options are provided as key/value pairs, with any/all of the following keys:

    {
      :follow-redirects    (default: true)     - whether to follow 30x redirects
      :timeout-ms          (default: 1000)     - timeout in ms (used for both the socket and connect timeouts)
      :user-agent          (default: \"unfurl\") - user agent string to send in the HTTP request
      :max-content-length  (default: 16384)    - maximum length (in bytes) of content to retrieve (using HTTP range requests)
      :proxy-host          (default: nil)      - HTTP proxy hostname
      :proxy-port          (default: nil)      - HTTP proxy port
